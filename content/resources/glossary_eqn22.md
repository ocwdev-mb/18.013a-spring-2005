description: Mathematical symbol for the partial derivative of f with respect to x,
  keeping y, and z fixed. In general a partial derivative of f with respect to a variable
  q is the ratio of df to dq when certain other variables are held fixed. Where there
  is possible misunderstanding over which variables are to be fixed that information
  should be made explicit.
